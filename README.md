## Part 1: Questions for MechaCar_mpg

### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

The vehicle length and vehicle ground clearance provide

### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

The slope is not considered zero, because our p-value is 5.35e_11 which would mean not zero so there has to be a slope even if small.

### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

The multiple R-squared is .7149, or 71.49%, so yes the model predicts it effectively.
